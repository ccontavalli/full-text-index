Introduction
============
This index implements a suffix array, using 32 bits for each entry.

How to make
===========
To make the index just give the command 'make index', this will
create 'SAu.a'.

How to use the index

http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl
And, include, in your program, interface.h located in
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/utils/


How to compile using the index
==============================
To use this index you must compile your program linking 'SAu.a'
For example:
gcc your_program.c -o your_program SAu.a

Special options and cases
=========================
-if build_option="copy_text" the index will copy the text
an internal variable, and free it when the index is destroy.
Otherwise the index will not own the text itself,
then when you free the index the text will not be free.

-if build_option="copy_text;free_text" the index will copy
the text and free it immediately after copy it.

-To save an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename. The index will create a file "xxxx.sa"

-To load an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename, and it will load "xxxx" and "xxxx.sa" at search time.
