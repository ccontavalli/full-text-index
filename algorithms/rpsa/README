Introduction
============
This index implements a suffix array, using 32 bits for each entry.

How to make
===========
To make the index just give the command 'make index', this will
create 'SA_BPE.a'.

How to use the index
====================
Just follow the API presented in the site:
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl
And, include, in your program, interface.h located in
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/utils/


How to compile using the index
==============================
To use this index you must compile your program linking 'SAu.a'
For example:
g++ your_program.c -o your_program SA_BPE.a

Special options and cases
=========================
-if build_option="copy_text" the index will copy the text
an internal variable, and free it when the index is destroy.
Otherwise the index will not own the text itself,
then when you free the index the text will not be free.

-if build_option="copy_text;free_text" the index will copy
the text and free it immediately after copy it.

-if build_option="samplerate=<number>" the index will store
an absolute of the suffix array every multiple of <number>. 
The default value is 64.

if build_option="SA_treap" the index will be constructed
using a treap. This is the exact algoritm for Repair 
but is rather slow.
  In this case (SA_treap) we have two extra options
    -if build_option="max_phrase=<number>" the phrases can not
    cross every <number> positions of the suffix array.
    The default value is 256.
    -if build_option="cutoff=<number>" the index will apply Repair
    while the dictionary size is lower than <number> % of the Suffix
    array. The default value is 100.
  Also for this case in bpe.cpp we have three defines:
    #define BPE_MINIMO 1
    #define BPE_MINIMOTREAP 1
    #define NUM_MAX_RULES 312500 //10.000.000 (*32)
    -BPE_MINIMO establishs that pairs with frequency > BPE_MINIMO 
     will be used the first time.
    -BPE_MINIMOTREAP establishs that only new pairs with frequency > BPE_MINIMOTREAP
     will be inserted in the treap.
    -NUM_MAX_RULES establishs the number of rules that can be 
     following to make the statistics. This is needed for cutoff.

if build_option="SA_psi" the index will be constructed
using the Psi function. This is an aproximated algoritm for
Repair but is faster.

if build_option="verbose" the index will be constructed
showing some statistics. 

-To save an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename. The index will create a file "xxxx.sa_bpe"

-To load an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename, and it will load "xxxx" and "xxxx.sa_bpe" at search time.
