Introduction
============
This index implements a suffix array, using ceil(lg(n)) bits for
each entry. Where n is the length of the text and lg is logarithm
in base 2.

How to make
===========
To make the index just give the command 'make index', this will
create 'SAc.a'.

How to use the index
====================
Just follow the API presented in the site:
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl
And, include, in your program, interface.h located in 
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/utils/


How to compile using the index
==============================
To use this index you must compile your program linking 'SAc.a'
For example:
gcc your_program.c -o your_program SAc.a

Special options and cases
=========================
-if build_option="copy_text" the index will copy the text
an internal variable, and free it when the index is destroy.
Otherwise the index will not own the text itself,
then when you free the index the text will not be free.

-if build_option="copy_text;free_text" the index will copy
the text and free it immediately after copy it.

-To save an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as 
filename. The index will create a file "xxxx.sac"

-To load an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as 
filename, and it will load "xxxx" and "xxxx.sac" at search time.
