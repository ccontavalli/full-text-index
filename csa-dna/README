Introduction
============
   This file contains an implementation of the interface for CSA
   supporting only DNA files.

How to make
===========
To make the index just give the command 'make', this will
create 'csa.a', 'csa_build', 'csa_run'.

How to use the index
====================
Just follow the API presented in the site:
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl
And, include, in your program, interface.h located in
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/utils/


How to compile using the index
==============================
To use this index you must compile your program linking 'csa.a'
For examples:
gcc your_program.c -lm -o your_program csa.a

IMPORTANT
=========
The input string should consist of only 'acgt'.

Special options and cases
=========================
-if build_option="-D <number>" then samplerate will be
interval between two indices of the suffix array stored explicitly.
That is, SA[i*samplerate] is stored explicitly. The default value is 64.

-if build_option="-D2 <number>" then samplerate will be
interval between two indices of the inverse suffix array stored explicitly.
That is, ISA[i*samplerate] is stored explicitly. The default value is 256.
Note that "-D <number>" also sets D2 value as <number>*4.

-if build_option="-L <number>" then rank values are sampled for
every 2^<number> numbers.  The default value is 8, that is, for
every 256 values.

-if you want specify more than one option, separate them with a blank.
For example:
build_option="-D 16 -D2 32 -L 7"
