Introduction
============
This index implements an Alphabet-Friendly FM-index.
For more information, see [FMMN05].

How to make
===========
To make the index just give the command 'make index', this will
create 'af-index.a'.

How to use the index
====================
Just follow the API presented in the site:
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl
And, include, in your program, interface.h located in
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/utils/


How to compile using the index
==============================
To use this index you must compile your program linking 'af-index.a'
For examples:
g++ your_program.cpp -o your_program af-index.a

Special options and cases
=========================
-if build_option="free_text" the index will 
free the text immediately after finish used it.

-if build_option="samplerate=<number>" the index will 
mark one text position every <number> entries. The default value is 64.

-if build_option="factor=<number>" the rank structures will use (1/factor)%
of overhead to resolve the rank queries. The default value is 4.

-if you want specify more than one option, separate them with a ";".
For example:
build_option="free_text;samplerate=64"

-To save an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename. The index will create a file "xxxx.af"

-To load an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename, and it will load "xxxx.af".
