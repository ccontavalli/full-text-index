This is the implementation of a reduced version of the Navarro's
LZ-index data structure. For a text T of length u, this version
requires (3+epsilon)uH_k + o(u log(sigma)) bits, where H_k is the
k-th order emperical entropy of T, and sigma is the alphabet size.

To build: make

It generates the LZ-index library in the file "lzindex.a"

To use: To use the LZ-index library, please compile your main program along with
the file "lzindex.a". For example, if your program is "run_queries.c", then you
must use:

# gcc run_queries.c -o run_queries lzindex.a
