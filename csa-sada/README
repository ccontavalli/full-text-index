Introduction
============
   This file contains an implementation of the interface for CSA.

How to make
===========
To make the index just give the command 'make index', this will
create 'csa.a'.

How to use the index
====================
Just follow the API presented in the site:
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl
And, include, in your program, interface.h located in
http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/utils/


How to compile using the index
==============================
To use this index you must compile your program linking 'af-index.a'
For examples:
gcc your_program.c -lm -o your_program csa.a

IMPORTANT
=========
-The function save has not been implemented, every time you build a index
automatically will be saved.
-This index does not support text with symbols equals to zero, please
remap zero in your text and queries.

Special options and cases
=========================
-if build_option="free_text" the index will 
free the text immediately after finish used it.

-if build_option="samplerate=<number>" then samplerate will be
interval between two indices of the suffix array stored explicitly.
That is, SA[i*samplerate] is stored explicitly. The default value is 16.

-if build_option="samplepsi=<number>" then samplepsi will be
interval between two indices of the psi function stored explicitly.
That is, Psi[i*samplepsi] is stored explicitly. The default value is 128.

-if you want specify more than one option, separate them with a ";".
For example:
build_option="free_text;samplerate=64"

-To save an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename. The index will create two files "xxxx.idx" and "xxxx.psi".

-To load an index of a text file "xxxx", always give "xxxx" as
filename, and it will load "xxxx.idx" and "xxxx.psi".
